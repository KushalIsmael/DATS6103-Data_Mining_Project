## Order to run code:
1. Model_Code.py
2. GUI_Code.py

## Model_Code.py
This script reads in our datset, contains our preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, experimental modeling, and a class that populates the model portion of our GUI.

## GUI_Code.py
This script creates and runs our GUI application using PyQt5. It reads in the data using code from the Model_Code.py file, creates EDA plots, runs a random forest model, and displays the outputs of the model.
