# Predicting Voter Behavior

## Description
This repository contains [Bradley Reardon](https://github.com/breardon7), [Divya Parmar](https://github.com/dparmar16/), and [Kushal Ismael](https://github.com/KushalIsmael/)'s final project for George Washington University's DATS 6103 - Data Mining course.
Our project objective was to apply what we learned in our course to a real world problem. For our project we applied preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to survey data from FiveThirtyEight and Ipsos on American voting behavior.

We cleaned the data for this project and analyzed decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models of the data in Python. We created a GUI using PyQT for users to interact with the data and experiment with models.
